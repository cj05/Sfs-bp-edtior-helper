# Sfs-bp-edtior-helper
Help people to create bp for sfs!
Uses input of an algorithm 
As like this C|2,3-T|2,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,1,”_”,”_” 
should give a capsule with fuel tank!
This is a prototype yet,so expect bugs!
It will need 2 files to run the edtior and chrtk
Chrtk is what you ask?
It’s a keyword/part containment file
Store what attributes part have and it’s default value
Do not use this for any kind of piracy
Such as getting locked parts
